What I learned from creating this product:
- The power of encapsulation. Having a component that works in any environment is needed when it is being used in many places.
- The benefits of asynchronous/non-blocking calls. The website doesn't shut down while waiting for calls to complete.
- Agile development. Frequent reassessment and adaptation of plans, breaking down tasks into small enough steps to prevent misdirection.
- The importance of regression testing. Make sure all previous behaviors exist after adding new code.
- Images can be encoded into a string (base64).
